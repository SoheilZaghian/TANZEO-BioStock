# TANZEO-BioStock:
Enhancing Biomass and Carbon Stock Estimation in Tanzanian Forests: Integrating Earth Observation and Machine Learning for Sustainable Forest Management and Food Security 

## Overview
**TANZEO-BioStock** is a research project providing forest canopy height (FCH), above-ground biomass (AGB), and above-ground carbon (AGC) datasets derived from multi-source Earth observation data for the **West Usambara Mountains, Tanzania**.

The project supports scientific analyses presented in peer-reviewed publications and promotes open and reproducible research in remote sensing and forest carbon assessment. This project is funded by EO AFRICA R&D Facility, in coordination with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the African Union Commission (AUC).
