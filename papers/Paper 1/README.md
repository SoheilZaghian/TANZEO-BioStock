## Abstract
Forest Canopy Height (FCH) is one of the key variables for understanding forest structure distribution and growth. Remotely sensed data such as the NASA Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) ATL08 provides accurate FCH measurements; however, its point-based nature limits spatial continuity. This study addresses the challenge by generating a continuous FCH map over the West Usambara Mountain Forests in Tanzania through integration of ATL08 product with multi-source remote sensing inputs, including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and SRTM DEM. The proposed methodology consists of four key stages: (1) preparation of a remote sensing feature cube, (2) preprocessing and noise removal of ATL08 segments, (3) spatial alignment and integration of ICESat-2 footprints with RS data patches, and (4) canopy height modeling using optimized machine learning regression, primarily Random Forest. Results showed that spectral indices and SAR features effectively predict canopy height, achieving an R2 of 0.29 and an RMSE of 8.64 m.
